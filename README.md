# MNIST

<p align='justify'> The MNIST dataset, which stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and image processing. It consists of a collection of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with a total of 70,000 images. The dataset is divided into a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each image is a grayscale image with a size of 28x28 pixels. </p>

## How to get the data

In order to get the data, I downloaded the tar.gz directly from the official MNIST site maintained by Marc Lelarge. You can download as well in the following link.
